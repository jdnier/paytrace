TODO:

* Incorporate recent API updates described here: http://help.paytrace.com/review-recent-changes-updates-to-the-api.

* Explain setting ENABLEPARTIALAUTH='N' to disable partial approvals.


Questions for PayTrace:

* Is it ok to assume that responses are UTF-8 encoded (or compatible ISO-8859-1)?

* The latest API PDF is dated July 2011. Is there a later version somewhere?
  Logging into the PayTrace web site as the demo user, there's a link to an
  October, 2011 API PDF:

    http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27003654/UserGuides/PayTraceAPIUserGuide.pdf

* Is there a diff-able source for the PDF (maybe HTML)?

* Will the PDF API doc be updated with the recent updates?
