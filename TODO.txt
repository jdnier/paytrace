TODO:

* Incorporate recent API updates described here: http://help.paytrace.com/review-recent-changes-updates-to-the-api.

* Explain setting ENABLEPARTIALAUTH='N' to disable partial approvals.


Questions for PayTrace:

* Is it ok to assume that responses are UTF-8 encoded (or compatible ISO-8859-1)?

* The latest API PDF is dated July 2011. Is there a later version somewhere?

* Is there a diff-able source for the PDF (maybe HTML)?

* Will the PDF API doc be updated with the recent updates?
